## 🔎TL;DR

1. We provide a fully configured macOS-based OpenClaw environment that runs out-of-the-box on both Linux and Windows via Docker. In addition, we address the complex permission issues in macOS, ensuring that OpenClaw can execute tasks without failing due to permission restrictions. Everyone is welcome to try it out and contribute! 👏
2. We introduce a benchmark designed to evaluate OpenClaw in real-world usage scenarios. 
It covers both the default tasks supported by OpenClaw and tasks commonly encountered in real working environments.

3. Our evaluation relies on manually designed rule-based evaluators, avoiding the uncertainty introduced by using LLMs as judges.
Each task is executed in an independent container, ensuring that tasks do not interfere with each other during evaluation.

## 🚀Quick Start

Want to try the image first? Start with Part 1. Want to run benchmark evaluation? Jump to Part 2.

### 1. Try OpenClaw in macOS on Linux or Windows

1. Download the required image files from Hugging Face (~40GB):

```bash
pip install huggingface_hub

huggingface-cli download JetLM/OpenClaw-macOS --local-dir .
```

2. Start the macOS Docker container:

```bash
bash launcher/docker/simple_start.sh
```

3. Connect to macOS:

```bash
vncviewer localhost:5901
```

Next, open OpenClaw. You should see the OpenClaw icon in the top menu bar, which means you are ready to start using OpenClaw on macOS.

</p>

### 2. Run the evaluation benchmark

1. Download the required image files from Hugging Face (~50GB):

```bash
pip install huggingface_hub

huggingface-cli download JetLM/OpenClaw-macOS --local-dir .
```

2. Fill in your API key and base URL in [`openclaw.json`](/home/fuyikun/Documents/MacAgentBench/openclaw.json).

3. Update the required local paths in [`eval.sh`](/home/fuyikun/Documents/MacAgentBench/eval.sh), especially the image paths and your local `WORK_DIR`.

4. Start the evaluation:

```bash
bash eval.sh
```

## 📋Benchmark feature

1. Compared to existing benchmarks for evaluating OpenClaw (e.g., PinchBench and Terminal Bench), our benchmark focuses primarily on real-world user scenarios.
All tasks are executed on macOS rather than Linux, bridging the gap between evaluation environments and actual usage scenarios. This provides a more realistic assessment of OpenClaw’s capabilities in everyday workflows.

2. Our benchmark supports testing all skills provided by OpenClaw by default, ensuring that even newly deployed lobsters 🦞 can be evaluated fairly and comprehensively.

3. The benchmark includes a wide range of macOS-specific scenarios and capabilities, such as productivity workflows using Apple Numbers, Apple Pages, and Apple Keynote, as well as native macOS applications like Notes, Reminders, and other GUI-dependent tasks.
This allows us to evaluate OpenClaw’s capabilities from multiple perspectives across realistic desktop workflows.

<!-- 4. The tasks included in the benchmark are collected from frequent real-world usage scenarios shared by users of OpenClaw across the internet. -->


Our benchmark currently covers **110** tasks across **18** macOS app and tool categories, reflecting real-world OpenClaw usage scenarios. Each task is designed to test specific capabilities, from productivity apps to terminal utilities.
